# mongoDB-assignment
NU Bootcamp Week 18 assigment

First, figure out how to delete node_modules - it was in the gitignore folder (complete)

This assignment will allow the user to scrape titles of and links to news headlines, store or delete them as favorites, and add notes to each.

MongoDB will store the data, rather than a local array (cf NYT News Scraper).

The 'public' folder contains the app and index page.
The 'models' folder contains our two models, 'Article' and 'Note', for storing our data to Mongo.

The 'assets' folder holds style and images, if they are ultimately used. Future iterations of this assigment might use React to render the CSS.
