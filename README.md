# mongoDB-assignment
NU Bootcamp Week 18 assigment

This assignment will allow the user to scrape titles of and links to news headlines, store or delete them as favorites, and add notes to each.

MongoDB will store the data, rather than a local array (cf NYT News Scraper).

The 'public' folder contains the app and index page.
The 'models' folder contains our two models, 'Article' and 'Note', for storing our data to Mongo.

The 'assets' folder holds style and images, if they are ultimately used. Future iterations of this assigment might use React to render the CSS.

STATUS: Tuesday, 10/9/18, 5:00PM
    - Deployed to github and heroku, working on heroku. Articles are being scraped and sent to both local and heroku databases
    - Notes are not being saved, "save note" button is not being recognized.
